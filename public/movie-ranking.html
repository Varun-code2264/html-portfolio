<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>
    An eye-opener for today's world<br />
    that doesn't think that every child is special.
</p>
<h3>31 days</h3>
<p>
    Shown strong determination and will-power by <br />
    a blind man for proving himself.
</p>
<h3>Naach ga Ghuma</h3>
<p>
    Super beautiful film.<br />
    Shows trust and companionship.
